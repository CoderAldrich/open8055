jpdoplib.inc

	The TinyCAD source of the circuit schematics and John P. Doty's OP-AMP library.


Thermistor 10K to Open8055 with OP-AMP.pcb
pads.net

	The PCB layout created with ExpressPCB. The file pads.net is the netlist file
	in PADS-PCB format created by TinyCAD.

Thermistor 10K to Open8055 with OP-AMP silkscreen.png

	Images of the schematics and PCB layout in case you don't have the above
	software installed. The PCB bottom and silkscreen images are to scale for
	printing. Using a laserprinter with glossy inkjet photo paper and
	print settings for high glossy finish, the resulting print can be heat
	transferred to copper clad circuit board for etching.
